Build from:
https://github.com/ATrefzer/automatic-graph-layout

1. The NuGet package wasn't updated for years, but the original main branch has some bug fixes I need (sub-graph labels).
2. I hide the collapse button on sub-graphs by default.
	- Library crashes sometimes when collapsing sub-graphs.
	- Library cannot render empty sub-graphs properly.	
	- So, I implemented the collapsing/expanding via the context menu myself.
 	  This has also the advantage that I can load large but collapsed graphs.
3.  Removed the debug code running in the release build.
