IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.
- Consider adding the access modifiers. We could get rid of all private members.

- Margins for Tables
- Metrics and Analyzer tables are implemented differently but could be unified
	- Extend Metric grid

- More Source Locations (copied???)
- ctor calls are not detected


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
- Two projects with same name
- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, lambdas
