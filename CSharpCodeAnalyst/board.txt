IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.

- Consider adding the access modifiers. We could get rid of all private members.

- Verification that code Syntax is handled only in one place. Check that a dependency has multiple source Locations with the same file and line.


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at the class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
  => Not useful enough to implement.
- Two projects with the same name
- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, Lambdas. Calls are attributed to the defining method.
  However, the execution may be elsewhere. I could mark such calls, and while ok for the dependency graph, it is wrong when following call chains.
