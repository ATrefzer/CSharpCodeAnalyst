IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.

- Consider adding the access modifiers. We could get rid of all private members.


- Virtual Refactorings: Select Move Target
    => Rules
- Virtual Refactorings: Move Code Element (including all children)
    => Rules
- Virtual Refactorings: TreeView Update may be slow


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at the class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
  => Not useful enough to implement.
  
- Two projects with the same name (discard one, breaks the symbol key mechanics)

BUGS 
---------------------

- Key down gets lost. Not even called on the MainWindow!?


MISSING TEST CASES
---------------------


CLARIFY
---------------------

- Export to png or clipboard with high DPI
