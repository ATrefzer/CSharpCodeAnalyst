IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.

- Consider adding the access modifiers. We could get rid of all private members.

- Search should filter external code.


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at the class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
  => Not useful enough to implement.
- Two projects with the same name
- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, Lambdas. Calls are attributed to the defining method.
  However, the execution may be elsewhere. I could mark such calls, and while ok for the dependency graph, it is wrong when following call chains.

BUGS
---------------------

- Get rid of local methods or lambdas.
- What was the reason for the normalized ctor?
- How can I disable external parsing. Old tests should working after removing external code.

- Add Fallback to parent no longer valid? Now we add external code element?
    => Only enums or other cases
    => Clarify: Primary constructor
    => What else?

- Anonymous class is shown as external code. Only named types!

public class ApplicationSettings
{
    public void Save(string appSettingsPath)
    {
        var root = new { ApplicationSettings = this };
    }
}
