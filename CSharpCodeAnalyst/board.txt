IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- SybolEqualityComparer does not work for this application well. Remove it where it is used.
- Check if the map key -> Symbol is unique. If not use a list of symbols!
  _elementIdToSymbolMap. Are all locations captured in this case?


- Highlight of aggregated edges takes too long. If quick help not visible skip?
- Performance in general

- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
