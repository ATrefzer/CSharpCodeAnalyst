IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.

- Consider adding the access modifiers. We could get rid of all private members.


- Virtual Refactorings: TreeView Update may be slow
- Property has not much contrast to method
- Namespace icon differs from others
- Jump to Code from context menu?
- Focus on flagged.

- EventArgs import export service.
- Collapsed nodes should be recognized



UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at the class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
  => Not useful enough to implement.
  
- Two projects with the same name (discard one, breaks the symbol key mechanics)

- Properties may show a cycle because get and set are combined into one property element.
  This may lead to a false positive cycle but is as intended.

BUGS 
---------------------

- Key down gets lost. Not even called on the MainWindow!?


MISSING TEST CASES
---------------------


CLARIFY
---------------------

- Export to png or clipboard with high DPI
