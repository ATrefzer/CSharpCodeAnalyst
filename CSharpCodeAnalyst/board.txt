IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Move remaining global commands to GraphViewModel
- Move Undo/Redo to GraphViewModel

- Highlight of aggregated edges takes too long. If quick help not visible skip?
- Performance in general

- Locations are stored for Gallery. This is not necessary. Remove it.


- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
