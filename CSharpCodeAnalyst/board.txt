IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Highlight of aggregated edges takes too long. If quick help not visible skip?
- Performance in general

- Locations are stored for Gallery. This is not necessary. Remove it.
- Save Jso without spaces. This will reduce the size of the file.



- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
