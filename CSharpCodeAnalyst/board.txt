IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- SybolEqualityComparer does not work for this application well. Remove it where it is used.
- Check if the map key -> Symbol is unique. If not use a list of symbols!
  _elementIdToSymbolMap. Are all locations captured in this case?


- Highlighting aggregated edges takes too long. If quick help is not visible then skip.
- Performance in general

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
