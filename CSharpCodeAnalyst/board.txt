IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Performance in general
- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, lambdas
- Tree is very slow

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
- Two projects with same name
