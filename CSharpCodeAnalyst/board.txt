IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.
- The context menu for partitioning should not be in the code graph canvas.
  It always referes to the full graph.

UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Remove local functions
- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
- Two projects with same name
- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, lambdas
