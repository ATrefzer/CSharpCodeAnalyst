IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, lambdas

- Highlighting aggregated edges takes too long. If quick help is not visible then skip.
- Performance in general

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
