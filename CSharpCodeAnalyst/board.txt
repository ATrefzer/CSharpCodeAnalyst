IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------

- Replace Guid with symbol key. Does it have an impact on memory or performance?
  Having the symbol key would allow synchronization with a project in the future.
- Consider adding the access modifieres. We could get rid of all private members.

- Generic table view model


UNHANDLED CASES
---------------------

- Attributes are caught at class or method level. Not for the parameters like [CallerMemberName]
- Two projects with same name
- Anonymous methods like PdsOnElementCreated, lambdas
