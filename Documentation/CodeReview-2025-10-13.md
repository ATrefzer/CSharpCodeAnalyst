  1. CODE DUPLICATION ISSUES

  High Priority

  A. Object Creation Duplication in LambdaBodyWalker (Lines 34-62)
  - VisitImplicitObjectCreationExpression and VisitObjectCreationExpression have nearly identical code
  - Both just extract type and call AddTypeRelationshipPublic
  - This logic duplicates part of what AnalyzeObjectCreation does in RelationshipAnalyzer
  - Impact: Maintenance burden, divergence risk

  B. GetSymbolInfo/GetTypeInfo Pattern Repeated
  - LambdaBodyWalker:39, 54, 68, 115 - Same pattern: get symbol/type, check, add relationship
  - Could be extracted to helper methods

  C. Normalization Logic Scattered
  - RelationshipAnalyzer:311, 822, 950, 1022, 1067 - OriginalDefinition handling appears 5+ times
  - Inconsistent: sometimes uses OriginalDefinition, sometimes NormalizeToOriginalDefinition
  - Should be centralized in one place

  Medium Priority

  D. Symbol Type Checking Pattern
  - Multiple if/else chains checking IPropertySymbol, IFieldSymbol, IEventSymbol
  - Appears in: RelationshipAnalyzer:162-171, 184-198, LambdaBodyWalker:119-133
  - Could use a switch expression or visitor pattern

  2. OVERCOMPLEXITY ISSUES

  High Priority

  A. AddRelationshipWithFallbackToContainingType (Lines 997-1066)
  - 70 lines long, does too much
  - Handles: symbol lookup, normalization, internal/external distinction, fallback logic, external element creation
  - Should be: Multiple smaller methods with clear single responsibilities
  - Difficult to test and understand

  B. DetermineCallAttributes + AnalyzeMemberAccessCallType (Lines 1163-1235)
  - Two methods to determine one thing (call attributes)
  - Nested switch/if logic that's hard to follow
  - Could be simplified with pattern matching or a lookup table

  C. AnalyzeInvocation (Lines 36-103)
  - Handles: method calls, generic types, event invocations, multiple special cases
  - The event invocation detection with conditional access traversal (lines 72-85) is particularly complex
  - Could be split into smaller focused methods

  Medium Priority

  D. Comments Indicate Complexity
  - Line 295: "(!) We do not want a fallback..." - indicates confusing behavior
  - Line 1039: "FALLBACK BEHAVIOR: Currently creates..." - configuration through comments
  - These suggest the logic is too implicit

---
  3. MISSING CASES (Potentially Significant)

  Likely Missing

  A. Arguments in Lambdas
  - MethodBodyWalker has VisitArgument (line 56)
  - LambdaBodyWalker does NOT have VisitArgument
  - Impact: Lambda like x => Foo(SomeMethod) won't track method groups passed as arguments

  B. Cast and Type Testing Expressions
  - No handling for: (MyType)obj, obj as MyType, obj is MyType
  - These reference types but aren't tracked
  - Impact: Type dependencies missed

  C. typeof() Expressions
  - No VisitTypeOfExpression
  - typeof(MyClass) creates a type dependency but isn't tracked
  - Impact: Reflection-related dependencies missed

  D. Default Expressions
  - No VisitDefaultExpression
  - default(MyType) references a type
  - Impact: Some type dependencies missed

  E. Tuple Types
  - No special handling for (int, string) or ValueTuple<T1, T2>
  - Impact: Tuple type arguments might not be fully tracked

  F. Switch Expressions and Pattern Matching
  - No VisitSwitchExpression or VisitIsPatternExpression
  - Patterns can reference types: obj is MyType t
  - Impact: Modern C# pattern type dependencies missed

  G. Collection Expressions (C# 12)
  - No handling for [1, 2, 3] collection expressions
  - Impact: Newer C# syntax not tracked

  H. throw Expressions
  - No VisitThrowExpression
  - throw new MyException() creates object but might not be tracked in all contexts
  - Impact: Exception types might be missed in expression contexts

  I. Query Expressions (LINQ)
  - No VisitQueryExpression
  - from x in list select x.Foo() implicitly calls methods and creates lambdas
  - Impact: LINQ method dependencies missed

  Questionable Omissions

  J. await Expressions
  - No special handling for await
  - Probably fine since the method call is tracked normally

  K. Indexers
  - No special VisitElementAccessExpression
  - Indexer access like list[0] calls a property but might not be tracked
  - Impact: Indexer dependencies potentially missed

  L. Operator Overloading
  - a + b might call a custom operator method
  - Not explicitly tracked
  - Impact: Operator method dependencies missed

---
  4. ARCHITECTURAL & CONSISTENCY ISSUES

  High Priority

  ~~A. Inconsistent Comment (LambdaBodyWalker:10)~~
  - ~~Comment says: "Only tracks type relationships... but NOT method calls"~~
  - ~~BUT NOW IT DOES track method invocations (after our change)~~
  - ~~Comment is outdated and misleading~~

  B. Inconsistent Behavior: IdentifierName
  - MethodBodyWalker:40-44 tracks all identifier names
  - LambdaBodyWalker:106-110 skips ALL identifier names
  - Problem: In lambda x => myField, the field reference won't be tracked
  - Only tracked if it's member access x => this.myField
  - Impact: Direct field/property access in lambdas is missed

  C. Inconsistent Behavior: Assignment
  - MethodBodyWalker tracks assignments (for properties, fields, events)
  - LambdaBodyWalker completely skips assignments
  - Problem: Lambda like x => { field = value; return x; } doesn't track the field
  - Question: Is this intentional? If we track method uses, why not field/property uses in assignments?

  D. Missing Public Methods on Interface
  - AddSymbolRelationshipPublic was added to ISyntaxNodeHandler
  - But AddRelationshipWithFallbackToContainingType is what does the real work
  - Naming could be clearer: "Symbol" vs "Method/Property/Field/Event"

  E. "IsFieldInitializer" Boolean Parameter
  - Passed through multiple methods (AnalyzeObjectCreation, MethodBodyWalker constructor)
  - Changes relationship semantics (Uses vs Creates)
  - Better: Create a context object or separate methods for field initializers

  Medium Priority

  F. Semantic Model Passed Repeatedly
  - Every Analyze* method takes SemanticModel semanticModel
  - Could be stored in RelationshipAnalyzer as instance field during analysis
  - Impact: Extra parameter passing everywhere

  G. Location Handling Inconsistency
  - Sometimes SourceLocation? (nullable, optional)
  - Sometimes List<SourceLocation> (can be empty)
  - Sometimes [location] (creating list inline)
  - Better: Consistent approach throughout

  H. ISyntaxNodeHandler Interface Pollution
  - AddTypeRelationshipPublic and AddSymbolRelationshipPublic are only for LambdaBodyWalker
  - But they're on the public interface that MethodBodyWalker also implements
  - Better: Separate interface or internal methods with friend assembly access

  5. SPECIFIC CONCERNS

  RelationshipAnalyzer.cs

  A. Lines 214-247 (AnalyzeArgument)
  - Only handles method groups in arguments
  - What about other things passed as arguments? (lambdas, delegates, etc.)
  - Probably fine since base.VisitArgument in MethodBodyWalker handles children

  B. Lines 94 and 310 - Comments
  - "Note: Arguments are now handled by the MethodBodyWalker.VisitArgument"
  - These comments suggest a past refactoring
  - Good to have, but indicates prior confusion

  C. Lines 799-817 (AddCallsRelationship)
  - Handles extension methods, generic methods, fallback
  - Short but packed with logic
  - Could benefit from extracted methods

  LambdaBodyWalker.cs

  D. No base.Visit() calls in most methods
  - VisitInvocationExpression:97 - doesn't call base
  - VisitMemberAccessExpression:135 - doesn't call base
  - Problem: Arguments in invocations won't be visited
  - Impact: x => Foo(Bar()) tracks Foo but might miss types in Bar() arguments

  E. Lines 34-62 - Object Creation
  - Calls base.Visit() - will descend into arguments
  - Good! But inconsistent with VisitInvocationExpression which doesn't

  MethodBodyWalker.cs

  F. Line 54 - Expression Handling in MemberAccess
  - Comment explains walker handles Expression, analyzer handles Name
  - Good separation of concerns
  - Similar pattern needed elsewhere?

  6. RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

  Critical (Do First)

  1. Fix LambdaBodyWalker.VisitIdentifierName - Should track fields/properties like MethodBodyWalker
  2. Update outdated comment in LambdaBodyWalker (line 10)
  3. Add typeof() support - Common and important for reflection
  4. Add cast/is/as support - Very common operations
  5. Refactor AddRelationshipWithFallbackToContainingType - Split into smaller methods

  Important (Should Do)

  6. Add VisitArgument to LambdaBodyWalker - Track method groups in lambda arguments
  7. Consolidate object creation logic - Remove duplication in LambdaBodyWalker
  8. Centralize normalization - One place for OriginalDefinition logic
  9. Consider assignment tracking in lambdas - Or document why it's intentionally skipped
  10. Add pattern matching support - Increasingly common in modern C#

  Nice to Have

  11. Extract symbol type checking - Use switch expressions
  12. Simplify DetermineCallAttributes - Pattern matching
  13. Add query expression support - LINQ dependencies
  14. Add indexer support - Property-like tracking
  15. Consistent location handling - Pick one approach

  Overall Assessment

  Strengths:
  - Clear separation between MethodBodyWalker and LambdaBodyWalker intent
  - Good use of visitor pattern
  - Comprehensive tracking of most common cases

  Weaknesses:
  - Code duplication in walkers
  - ~~Overcomplexity in AddRelationshipWithFallbackToContainingType~~
  - Missing modern C# features (pattern matching, switch expressions)
  - Inconsistency between MethodBodyWalker and LambdaBodyWalker (identifier tracking)
  - Our recent change may have introduced more issues (not tracking argument children)

  Technical Debt Score: 6/10 (Medium-High)
  The code works but has accumulated complexity and inconsistency that will make future maintenance harder.
